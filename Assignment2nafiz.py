                -> Applying Ford Fulkerson  or Edmonds Karp algorithm to find max flow 

    My approach is to build a flow network to stracture the participanmts and activites as nodes 
    - We connect the participants to the source and we connect the activity to sink 
    - So each activity is connected to the sink node ; we created one set for leaders and one set for non leaders 
    where there capacity is 2 for l nodes and non leaders number of places/spots reserved - 2 i.e leaders have 2 places reserved and non leaders have places-2 reserved 
    -We then connect the participants to activity so atleast one partscipants has one activity and at least leader for each activity 
    - Then we perform fulkerson to mind the max flow 
    - Since all p needs to be allocated to an activity , hence the max flow needs to be same as n participants , if max flow is equal to number of participants
    - it's a valid assignment :)


    #this is my rough analysis a
    Rough= #FF flownetwork + source to participants + connecting to participants +activities to sink + ford fulkerson + max flow check 
    - Building the network: O(n * m), where n is the number of participants and m is the number of activities.
    - Ford-Fulkerson maximum flow: O(n^3), as we perform the max flow algorithm on a graph with O(n) nodes.
    - Overall: O(n^3)


    Complexity Analysis:
    - Initialization and setup: O(1)
    - Flow network initialization: O(n^2) / 
    - Connect source to participants: O(n)
    - Connect participants to activities: O(n^2)/ Nested loop over n participants and m activities: O(n m)
    - Connect activities to sink: O(m)
    - Ford-Fulkerson algorithm: ùëÇ(|ùëâ||ùê∏|2) ~O(n^3)
    - Constructing assignments: O(n^2)

    Overall Complexity: O(n^3), where n is the number of participants.
    Space Complexity: O(n^2)
    Auxiliary Space: O(n)
    
    
    Parameters:
    - preferences: List of lists indicating each participant's preferences for activities.
    - places: List indicating the number of places available for each activity.

    Returns:
    - A list of assignments if a valid assignment exists, otherwise None.

        This function checks the spelling of an input word and provides suggestions if it's misspelled
        (Using the three priority rules, the most same prefix length, the frequency of the word, and the lexicographical order).

        My Approach description:
        To solve this task, I implemented a trie(prefix tree)-based spell checker:
        1. First, I check if the word exists in my trie. If it does, I return an empty list since it's spelled correctly.
        2. If the word isn't found, I do a forward scan of the input word:
           - At each prefix point, I collect words from my trie that share the current prefix.
           - For each word I collect, I calculate how much of a prefix it shares with the input word.
           - I keep a list of the best suggestions, ordering them by prefix length, frequency, and alphabetically.
        3. Finally, I return the top 3 suggestions (or fewer if there aren't 3).

        I chose this approach because tries are really efficient for prefix-based operations. By scanning 
        forward and collecting words at each point, I make sure I don't miss any potential matches, even 
        if they diverge early from the input word. The tricky part was balancing efficiency with accuracy - 
        I had to be careful not to explore too much of the trie at each step, which is why I limit how many 
        words I collect each time.

        break down the time complexity:
        T(M, U) = O(M) + M * (O(1) + O(1) + O(M))
     
       However, this analysis assumes worst-case behavior for same_prefix_length and collect_words. In practice:
        1. same_prefix_length often terminates early, not always taking O(M) time.
        2. collect_words explores a portion of the trie, which we can represent as O(U), where U is the number of nodes in the trie.
        3. Therefore,we can say a more accurate representation of the time complexity is:

        T(M, U) = O(M) + O(U)


        Input:
        input_word: A string representing the word to be spell-checked.

        Output/ return:
        A list of strings containing up to 3 spelling suggestions. If the input word is correctly spelled
        (exists in the trie), an empty list is returned.

        Time complexity:
        after deducing  check above ^
        Best case: O(M)
        Worst case: O(M + U)
        Average case/Big O: O(M + U)
        Where M is the length of the input word and U is the number of nodes in the trie.

        Time complexity analysis:
      
        Best case: When the word exists in the trie, I only traverse the input word once: O(M).
        Worst case: I traverse the input word (O(M)) and potentially explore the entire trie at each
        prefix point (O(U)). Collecting and processing suggestions at each point is bounded by
        a constant factor, so it doesn't affect the overall complexity.
        Things to remember 

        Space and auxiliary space complexity:
        O(1)

        Space and auxiliary space complexity analysis:
        only using a constant amount of extra space for the suggestions list (max 3 items) and
        a few variables. The space I use doesn't grow with the input size or trie size.
